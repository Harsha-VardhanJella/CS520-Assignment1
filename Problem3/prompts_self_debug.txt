You are a Python engineer. Follow these two phases strictly:

Phase 1 — Silent reasoning:
- Generate the code.
- Mentally test the function on:
  ['a', 3.14, 5] → [5]
  [1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []] → [1, 2, 3]
- If you detect any incorrect behavior or failure to produce these results, silently fix your logic before proceeding.

Phase 2 — Output:
- Output ONLY the final valid Python code inside a Markdown code block.
- Do not include any reasoning, comments, or explanations.

from typing import List, Any

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter the given list to include only integers.
    """
    # write your code here
