You are a Python engineer. Follow these two phases strictly:

Phase 1 — Silent reasoning:
- Generate the code.
- Mentally test the function on:
  [1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3 → True
  [1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05 → False
- If any test fails or logic is unstable/inefficient, silently fix it before proceeding.

Phase 2 — Output:
- Output ONLY the final valid Python code inside a Markdown code block.
- Do not include any reasoning, comments, or explanations.

from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    Check if in the given list of numbers, any two numbers are closer to each other than the given threshold.
    """
    # write your code here
