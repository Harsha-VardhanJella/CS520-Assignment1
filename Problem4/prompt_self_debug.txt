You are a Python engineer. Follow these two phases strictly:

Phase 1 — Silent reasoning:
- Generate the code.
- Mentally test the function on:
  '' → 0
  'abc' → 3
  'asdasnakj' → 9
- If you detect any incorrect behavior or failure to produce these results, silently fix your logic before proceeding.

Phase 2 — Output:
- Output ONLY the final valid Python code inside a Markdown code block.
- Do not include any reasoning, comments, or explanations.

def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return the length of the given string.
    """
    # write your code here
