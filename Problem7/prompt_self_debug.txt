You are a Python engineer. Follow these two phases strictly:

Phase 1 — Silent reasoning:
- Generate the code.
- Mentally test the function on:
  [] → []
  [1, 2, 3, 4] → [1, 2, 3, 4]
  [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5] → [1, 4, 5]
- If any case fails or the logic is unstable/inefficient, silently fix it before proceeding.

Phase 2 — Output:
- Output ONLY the final valid Python code inside a Markdown code block.
- Do not include any reasoning, comments, or explanations.

from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep the order of the remaining elements the same as in the input.
    Example:
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    # write your code here
