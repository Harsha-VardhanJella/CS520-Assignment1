You are a Python engineer. Follow these two phases strictly:
Phase 1 — Silent reasoning:
- Generate the code.
- Mentally test the function on:
  3  → 1
  7  → 1
- If any case fails or the logic is unstable/inefficient, silently fix it before proceeding.

Phase 2 — Output:
- Output ONLY the final valid Python code inside a Markdown code block.
- Do not include any reasoning, comments, or explanations.

def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    For a given number n, return the largest number that divides n evenly and is smaller than n.
    Example:
    # write your code here
