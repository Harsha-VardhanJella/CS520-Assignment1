You are a Python engineer. Follow these two phases strictly:

Phase 1 — Silent reasoning:
- Generate the code.
- Mentally test the function on:
  '' → ''
  'Hello!' → 'hELLO!'
- If any case fails or the logic is unstable/inefficient, silently fix it before proceeding.

Phase 2 — Output:
- Output ONLY the final valid Python code inside a Markdown code block.
- Do not include any reasoning, comments, or explanations.

def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """
    For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase.
