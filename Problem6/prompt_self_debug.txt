You are a Python engineer. Follow these two phases strictly:

Phase 1 — Silent reasoning:
- Generate the code.
- Mentally test the function on:
  2 → [2]
  4 → [2, 2]
  8 → [2, 2, 2]
- If any case fails or the logic is unstable/inefficient, silently fix it before proceeding.

Phase 2 — Output:
- Output ONLY the final valid Python code inside a Markdown code block.
- Do not include any reasoning, comments, or explanations.

from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return the list of prime factors of n from smallest to largest.
    Each prime appears as many times as in the factorization.
    """
    # write your code here
